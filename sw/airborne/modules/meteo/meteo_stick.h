/**
 * @file modules/meteo/meteo_stick.h
 *
 * Data acquisition module for ENAC PTU board
 *
 * provides meteo data:
 * - temperature
 * - humidity
 * - absolute pressure
 * - differential pressure
 *
 * based on the ADS1220 spi ADC for pressures and temperature,
 * and PWM input for humidity
 *
 * data can be send other telemetry
 * and/or logged on SD card (on capable autopilots)
 *
 * designed and debugged by Michel Gorraz and Alexandre Bustico @ Enac (2014)
